Collections of builder to improve nodejs server creation

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Collections

My intention is to create builders for any valid library used in the world, like express and fastify.

And my final decision is to use [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), in this matter the user of this library (when i push on npm registry) can download only the part they needs.
